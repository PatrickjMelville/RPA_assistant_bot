# RPA_assistant_bot

This is an RPA assistant bot built using UIPath.
Currently this bot is able to provide to you the top 5 news stories in the last month for a topic of your choosing.
Additionally, it can also provide you with up-to-date covid data. Since both of these features use APIs, the accuracy/quality of the data
provided depends on the quality of the APIs used.

Another feature is its ability to open Microsoft Paint and sketch an image. The image sketched depends on a .jpeg file provided by the user.
By default, an image of a vertical line is provided to demonstrate the feature, however this can be replaced with an image of your choosing.
NOTE: The current version of the sketching feature can only sketch black and white images. Also in its current state, the process is very slow
and could take over an hour depending on the complexity of the image.

There are plans to keep adding more and more useful features to this bot, so it can be a more useful and reliable assistant bot.
